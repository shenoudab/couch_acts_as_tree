= couch-acts_as_tree

This is an implementation of a tree structure for CouchrestModel.

== Installation

Install as gem

  gem install couch_acts_as_tree

== Usage

Enable the tree functionality by declaring acts_as_tree on your model

  class Category < CouchRest::Model::Base
    include Couch::Acts::Tree

    property :name

    acts_as_tree
  end

The method accepts :parent_id_field, :path_field, :depth_field, :order as a hash.

  :parent_id_field, :path_field, :depth_field => override the default field names
  :order => control the order (format ['value', 'asc'] or [['field_1', 'asc'], ['field_2', 'desc']])

Check the test_tree.rb for examples.

== About bugs

Use it. If you find any bugs, contact me (if possible with a test case) or patch it yourself (see next section).

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
